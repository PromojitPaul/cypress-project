# Cypress Automation Testing Project

## Overview
This project is a Cypress-based automation testing suite designed to validate the functionality of a web application. It follows industry best practices to ensure robust, scalable, and maintainable test automation.

## Key Highlights
- Implemented end-to-end test automation using Cypress.
- Followed the Page Object Model (POM) for better test organization and maintainability.
- Validated critical user flows, UI elements, and business logic.
- Integrated test execution reports for better visibility.
- Configurable environment settings for different test scenarios.

## Technologies Used
- **Cypress**: JavaScript-based end-to-end test automation framework.
- **JavaScript/Node.js**: Used for scripting and execution.
- **Mocha & Chai**: Assertion libraries for test validations.
- **Mochawesome**: HTML report generation for test execution.
- **GitHub**: Version control and repository management.
